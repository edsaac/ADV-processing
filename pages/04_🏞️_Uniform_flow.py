## Roughness height

The roughness height $k_s$ for bed forms could be any size between 
the sediment grain size $d_{90}$ and the dunes height (a.k.a. amplitude $\Delta$).
A definition for $k_s$ was presented by ([van Rijn (1984](www.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1984)110:12(1733)), 
[O'Connor & Harvey (2008](https://doi.org/10.1029/2008WR007160)) to combine both
posible measures.

$$
    k_s = 3d_{90} + 1.1 \Delta \left(
        1 - \exp\left(
            -\dfrac{25\Delta}{\lambda}
            \right)
        \right)
$$

where $\lambda$ is the bedform lenght. The sand used in these experiments is 
Flint Silica 12 (US Silica, Ottawa, IL) with a $d_{50} = 0.42 \, \mathrm{mm}$.
